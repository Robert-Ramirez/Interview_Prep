    - Setup repository.
    - Review high level strategy and approach for interview prep.
    - Completed Chapter 1-3 of EPI in Java.
    - On Chapter 4 - Primitive Types
    - write java program counting bit

    - Read Chapter 4, include review of the primitives.
    - Complete practice problems in chapter 4.

- 09/10/2018:
    - What you should learn.
    - Tree Traversal (recursive and iterative)
    - BFS
    - DFS
    - Binary Search (log time)
    - Data structures to represent a tree
    - Elegant recursion (with helper functions) - know the limits of recursion - know how to convert to an iterative algo
    - Fibonacci
    - Stack and Queues
    - Given a string of parens, check if they're valid (use stack)
    - Object oriented programming (bring it up whenever you can) - class, parameters, public variables
    - Grid (2D array or Grid class?)
    - Hash Maps - Time space analysis, hashing function, collisions
    - Big O theory
    - Have different programming languages at your disposal, don't stick with PHP if you're interviewing for Java.
    - Sorting (bubble sort, merge sort)
    - Work with strings (palindrome, anagram)
    - "Dynamic programming" - Memoization
