# Primitive Types #

Know how int, char, double, etc.. are represented in memory and the primitive operations on them.

- Primitive Types:
    - Boolean
    - Integer
    - Character
    - Floating point data

- Need to know 
    - Sizes
    - Ranges
    - Signedness properties
    - operators
    - utility methods for primitive types in Math
    - difference between box-types(Integer, Double, etc...) and primitive types
    - role of auto-boxing and the limits of auto-boxing.

- Operators
